RSA is the most widely used public-key cryptography algorithm in the world.
It is also one of the most secure,
with only a few known attacks that can be used to break it.
but this is by design and not by accident.
One of the most interesting things about RSA is that it can be used for more than just encryption.
It can also be used for digital signatures and for key exchange.
The RSA algorithm is a public-key cryptosystem.
This means that there are two keys, a public key, and a private key.
The public key can be known by everyone and is used for encryption.
The private key is known only by the owner and is used for decryption.
The RSA algorithm is asymmetric, which means that the encryption and decryption keys are different.
RSA is a relatively old algorithm, having been developed in the 1970s by
Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman. It is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers
